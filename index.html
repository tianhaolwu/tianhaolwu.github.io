      Rebuilding After the Shock: Institutional Determinants of Social Policy Responses to COVID-19

        <p class="abstract-text">
          The COVID-19 pandemic created a global, simultaneous economic shock, but social protection responses were
          strikingly heterogeneous across countries. Countries varied not only in the size of their social protection
          budgets, but also in the types of programs they invested in. Using data from the social spending budget of
          134 countries, our analysis surfaces a seemingly counterintuitive finding: while low- and middle-income
          countries overwhelmingly focused on income protection measures, such as direct cash transfers to individuals,
          we find evidence of greater economic benefits from spending on employment protection programs designed to keep
          formal workers employed. Conversely, high-income countries, which spent relatively more on employment
          protection, exhibit suggestive evidence of stronger effects from income protection. Why did countries
          seemingly invest in mismatched policy responses? We contend that an institutional fit mechanism is at play
          whereby state fiscal capacity, previous welfare infrastructure, and labor market organization constrained
          governments’ social policy choices as well as mediated downstream policy effectiveness. Our findings suggest
          that the effectiveness of pandemic social protection depended less on a single “best” instrument than on how
          policy packages fit the fiscal and labor-market institutions into which they are introduced.

      Extreme Tariffs in a Decoupling World: Evidence from a 145% U.S. Tariff on China
      [<button class="abstract-toggle" onclick="toggleAbstract('tariff-abstract')">abstract</button>]
      <div id="tariff-abstract" class="abstract-content">
        <p class="abstract-text">
          What are the impacts of extreme tariffs between major trading partners? This paper examines the short-run adjustment of U.S. imports to a temporary 145 percent tariff on a broad set
          of Chinese HS10 products introduced in May 2025. Using over 7.62 million HS10–country–month observations for
          2023 to 2025 and a comparison group of low-tariff exporters, I estimate triple-difference and
          difference-in-differences models with event-study specifications. The tariff is associated with short-run
          declines of about one quarter in Chinese import quantities and values for treated products and modest cuts in
          Chinese export unit values, on top of pronounced non-parallel pre-trends consistent with ongoing decoupling.
          An extensive-margin design that conditions on stable total U.S. imports shows that in the very short run,
          entry by non-Chinese suppliers rises by only a few tenths of a percentage point when Chinese imports collapse
          and is concentrated in a small set of developed countries, implying that short-run substitution away from a
          systemic supplier under this tariff is possible but limited.
