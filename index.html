      Rebuilding After the Shock: Institutional Determinants of Social Policy Responses to COVID-19
      <br>
      (with Marysol Fernández Harvey and Joshua Fording)

        <p class="abstract-text">
          The COVID-19 pandemic created a global, simultaneous economic shock, but social protection responses were strikingly
          heterogeneous across countries. Countries varied not only in the size of their social protection budgets, but also in
          the types of programs they invested in. Using data from the social spending budget of 134 countries, our analysis
          surfaces a seemingly counterintuitive finding: While low- and middle-income countries overwhelmingly focused on income
          protection measures, such as direct cash transfers to individuals, we find evidence of greater economic benefits from
          spending on employment protection programs designed to keep formal workers employed. Conversely, high income countries,
          which spent relatively more on employment protection, exhibit suggestive evidence of stronger effects from income
          protection. Why did countries seemingly invest in mismatched policy responses? We contend that an institutional fit
          mechanism is at play whereby state fiscal capacity, previous welfare infrastructure, and labor market organization
          constrained governments’ social policy choices as well as mediated downstream policy effectiveness. Our findings suggest
          that the effectiveness of pandemic social protection depended less on a single “best” instrument than on how policy
          packages fit the fiscal and labor-market institutions into which they are introduced.

      Short Run Trade Adjustment to a Temporary 145 Percent U.S. Tariff on China
      [<button type="button" class="abstract-toggle" aria-expanded="false"

          How quickly can extreme tariffs reduce targeted imports and induce short-run sourcing away from a systemic supplier?
          This paper studies the 2025 U.S. episode that briefly raised additional duties on covered Chinese goods to about 145% and
          then rolled them back to roughly 30% under the first 90-day truce following the Geneva Accord. Using 7.62 million
          HS10–country–month U.S. import observations from 2023 to 2025 and the official coverage list, I estimate triple-difference
          effects traced with event-study dynamics. The design separates the immediate break at the escalation from persistence in
          the subsequent truce months. In June to August 2025, after the rollback, quantities and values drop sharply on impact and
          then partially recover, but are lower on average by about 27% and 28% relative to the same HS10 codes sourced from low-tariff
          exporters, while CIF unit values decline by about 1.7% on average. Diversification is partial and concentrates in established
          hubs. Extreme tariffs can quickly reduce exposure to a targeted supplier, but short-run resilience gains come mainly from
          shifting toward existing suppliers rather than building new ones.
