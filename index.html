          I am currently a third-year visiting undergraduate student at Harvard University and a BSc Economic History
          and Geography candidate at the London School of Economics (LSE). At LSE, I was the first student to be
          awarded with both the

          I am also the Co-Editor-in-Chief for the
          <a href="https://knowlesreview.lse.ac.uk/">Knowles Review of Economic History</a>, a journal published by the
          LSE Houghton Street Press.
          At Harvard College, I am a research associate at the
          <a href="https://www.charlesrivereconomicslabs.org/">Charles River Economic Labs</a>
          and am affiliated with
          <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/">The Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a>.
          In the summer of 2025, I worked as a policy intern at the State Administration for Market Regulation of China,
          and currently I am an intern at the United Nations.

          I aspire to conduct research that translates into real-world policy influence. I am broadly interested in
          development policy, political economy, energy policy, and international economics, with a regional focus on
          China and East Asia.

          <strong>Rebuilding After the Shock: Institutional Determinants of Social Policy Responses to COVID-19</strong><br>
          (with Marysol Fernández Harvey and Joshua Fording)

            <p>
              The COVID-19 pandemic created a global, simultaneous economic shock, but social protection responses were
              strikingly heterogeneous across countries. Countries varied not only in the size of their social
              protection budgets, but also in the types of programs they invested in. Using data from the social
              spending budget of 134 countries, our analysis surfaces a seemingly counterintuitive finding: while
              low- and middle-income countries overwhelmingly focused on income protection measures, such as direct
              cash transfers to individuals, we find evidence of greater economic benefits from spending on employment
              protection programs designed to keep formal workers employed. Conversely, high-income countries, which
              spent relatively more on employment protection, exhibit suggestive evidence of stronger effects from
              income protection. Why did countries seemingly invest in mismatched policy responses? We contend that an
              institutional fit mechanism is at play whereby state fiscal capacity, previous welfare infrastructure, and
              labor market organization constrained governments’ social policy choices as well as mediated downstream
              policy effectiveness. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of pandemic social protection depended
              less on a single “best” instrument than on how policy packages fit the fiscal and labor-market
              institutions into which they are introduced.

          <strong>Extreme Tariffs in a Decoupling World: Evidence from a 145% U.S. Tariff on China</strong>
          <br>
          <button class="abstract-toggle">abstract</button>
          <div class="abstract-content">
            <p>
              What are the impacts of extreme tariffs between major trading partners? This paper examines the short-run
              adjustment of U.S. imports to a temporary 145 percent tariff on a broad set of Chinese HS10 products
              introduced in May 2025. Using over 7.62 million HS10–country–month observations for 2023 to 2025 and a
              comparison group of low-tariff exporters, I estimate triple-difference and difference-in-differences
              models with event-study specifications. The tariff is associated with short-run declines of about one
              quarter in Chinese import quantities and values for treated products and modest cuts in Chinese export
              unit values, on top of pronounced non-parallel pre-trends consistent with ongoing decoupling. An
              extensive-margin design that conditions on stable total U.S. imports shows that in the very short run,
              entry by non-Chinese suppliers rises by only a few tenths of a percentage point when Chinese imports
              collapse and is concentrated in a small set of developed countries, implying that short-run substitution
              away from a systemic supplier under this tariff is possible but limited.
