  <p>I am a third-year BSc Economic History and Geogragraphy student at the London School of Economics (LSE). Currently,
    I am a visiting undergraduate student at Harvard College. At LSE, I was the recepient of the Lilian Knowles Prize
    for the Best Set of First-Year Marks and the Baines Prize for the Best Mark in EH101. I also currently serve as the

  <p>In the Summer of 2025, I was worked as an intern at the State Administration for Market Regulation of China, and I
    currently work as an intern at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)
    during the academic year.</p>

  <p>I am broadly interested in Chinese development policy, energy policy, economic development, and trade economics.</p>

    <li>Shifting Modernization and the Origins of Party System Cleavages. [<button class="abstract-toggle"
        onclick="toggleAbstract('modernization-abstract')">abstract</button>]
      <div id="modernization-abstract" class="abstract-content">
        <p class="abstract-text">Classical modernization theory holds that development shifts party competition from
          identities to class interests. I argue the opposite: not levels but the sequence of modernization
          determines long-run cleavage structure. I distinguish between social modernization--the spread of literacy,
          mass communication, and universal participation--and economic modernization--the shift out of agriculture into
          industry and services. The absolute and relative timing of these separable forms determines which social
          solidarities are available when mass politics begins. Early or concurrent social modernization foregrounds
          class and occupation; late social modernization, especially with late economic modernization, foregrounds
          ethnic, religious, linguistic, or regional identities. Uncertainty at entry into mass politics pushes voters
          and elites toward these existing organizations, and path dependence then locks them in: what I call a
          cleavage shift. To test this alternative modernization story, I digitize individual-level electoral
          rolls, censuses, tax lists, civil registration records, and telephone books across time, totaling over 2
          billion individual records, 30 countries, and a collective span of more than 150 years. A variety of empirical
          tests, including predicting vote choice for every individual in the data, align with the hypothesis of
          cleavage shift.

    <li>When Does Local Governance Matter? [<button class="abstract-toggle"
        onclick="toggleAbstract('localgov-abstract')">abstract</button>]
      <div id="localgov-abstract" class="abstract-content">
        <p class="abstract-text">Does local governance still shape economic outcomes in an era of globalized capital and
          post-industrial production? Classic theories of comparative political economy held that partisan control and
          labor organization determined growth in advanced democracies during the industrial era. Yet the structural
          transformation of these economies since the 1970s casts doubt on whether such mechanisms operate at the local
          level, where authority is tightly constrained and capital highly mobile. This paper reconsiders the question
          of whether ``who governs'' locally matters for economic performance under post-industrial conditions. I argue
          that the channels linking local political control to aggregate growth have weakened as production has become
          spatially fragmented and macroeconomic management centralized. To evaluate this argument, I assemble what is,
          to my knowledge, the largest multi-country collection of subnational political and economic data ever
          compiled: over two billion administrative and proprietary observations spanning multiple tiers of government,
          as well as polling station-level election returns in local contests across advanced democracies.
          The analysis combines regression-discontinuity designs around close elections with global boundary comparisons
          and newly constructed, fine-grained economic indicators—from satellite-derived estimates of gross regional
          product and night-time light intensity to property transactions, rent listings, job postings, and consumer
          spending patterns. Across settings, I find that turnover in local government has no measurable effect on
          aggregate economic growth or its rate of change. Instead, political turnover systematically alters the
          composition and spatial distribution of economic activity, reshaping who benefits from development and where
          gains are realized. I illustrate these distributive effects using a new, image-based measure of road quality
          derived from millions of street-level panoramas evaluated by vision–language models. Taken together, the
          results suggest that in the contemporary economy, local politics matters less for the quantity of growth than
          for its geography and beneficiaries.

    <li>Are Politics in the United States Nationalizing? (with Ryan Enos) [<button class="abstract-toggle"
        onclick="toggleAbstract('nationalization-abstract')">abstract</button>]
      <div id="nationalization-abstract" class="abstract-content">
        <p class="abstract-text">Are politics in the United States nationalizing? Increased polarization on the one hand
          seems discordant from recent scholarship arguing that nationalization has increased. We propose a measure of
          horizontal nationalization focusing on the level of political similarity between geographically distant but
          demographically similar places, and distinguish it from vertical nationalization, which is more commonly
          studied. Horizontal nationalization adheres closely to both classic and intuitive definitions of
          nationalization. Leveraging aggregate data at the state, county, and precinct level and individual data from
          surveys and voter files, we examine horizontal nationalization since the 19th century and find that it has
          decreased in recent decades from a peak in the late-20th century. We compare this to horizontal
          nationalization in France, which is higher and far more stable over the full time period. We suggest that one
          explanation for these fluctuations in the American case is the changing nature of the media landscape owing to
          technological development. Our findings have implications for recent literature in American politics on the
          influence of geographic and demographic sorting, and contrasts with recent prominent conceptualizations of
          nationalization that have focused on the levels of vertical unification between national and sub-national
          behavior to argue that nationalization has increased in recent years.
