    I am also the Co-Editor-in-Chief for the

    At Harvard College, I am a project lead at the

    I aspire to conduct research that translates into real-world policy influence. I am broadly interested in
    development policy, political economy, energy policy, and international economics, with a regional focus on China
    and East Asia.

      Rebuilding After the Shock: Institutional Determinants of Social Policy Responses to COVID-19
      <br>
      (with Marysol Fernández Harvey and Joshua Fording)

        <p class="abstract-text">
          The COVID-19 pandemic created a global, simultaneous economic shock, but social protection responses were
          strikingly heterogeneous across countries. Countries varied not only in the size of their social protection
          budgets, but also in the types of programs they invested in. Using data from the social spending budget of
          134 countries, our analysis surfaces a seemingly counterintuitive finding: while low- and middle-income
          countries overwhelmingly focused on income protection measures, such as direct cash transfers to individuals,
          we find evidence of greater economic benefits from spending on employment protection programs designed to keep
          formal workers employed. Conversely, high-income countries, which spent relatively more on employment
          protection, exhibit suggestive evidence of stronger effects from income protection. Why did countries
          seemingly invest in mismatched policy responses? We contend that an institutional fit mechanism is at play
          whereby state fiscal capacity, previous welfare infrastructure, and labor market organization constrained
          governments’ social policy choices as well as mediated downstream policy effectiveness. Our findings suggest
          that the effectiveness of pandemic social protection depended less on a single “best” instrument than on how
          policy packages fit the fiscal and labor-market institutions into which they are introduced.

      Short Run Trade Adjustment to a Temporary 145 Percent U.S. Tariff on China
      [<button class="abstract-toggle" onclick="toggleAbstract('tariff-abstract')">abstract</button>]
      <div id="tariff-abstract" class="abstract-content">
        <p class="abstract-text">
          How quickly can extreme tariffs reduce targeted imports and induce short-run sourcing away from a systemic supplier? This paper studies the 2025 U.S. episode that temporarily raised tariffs on covered Chinese goods to about 145% before the first 90-day truce. Using 7.62 million HS10–country–month U.S. import observations from 2023 to 2025 and the official coverage list, I estimate difference- in-differences effects traced with event-study dynamics. In June to August 2025, quantities and values of covered Chinese imports fall by about 25 to 30% relative to the same HS10 codes sourced from low-tariff exporters, while unit values decline by only 2 to 3%. Diversification is partial and concentrates in established hubs. Extreme tariffs can quickly reduce exposure to a targeted supplier, but short-run resilience gains come mainly from shifting toward existing suppliers rather than building new ones.
